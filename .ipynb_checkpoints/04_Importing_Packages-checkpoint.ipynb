    "For any other module you might want to use that is not local or not part of the Python standard library, you first have to install it before you can use it.\n",

    "**pip** - pip is the python installer that can be run at the commandline. If you find a package on PyPi that you want to install, read the installation instructions and it will tell you what it's name is in PyPi. Then you go to the commandline and type:\n",
    "\n",
    ">  pip install package_name\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use pip to update or uninstall packages. Pip ensures that the packages is installed where your python environment can see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**conda** - [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/pkgs.html) works like pip for packages that are part of the Anaconda Python distribution for scientific computing in Python. If you already have miniconda from your Python installation, you go to the commandline and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "> conda install package_name\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python distributions** - Python distributions are versions of Python that come with extra modules. For example, the full Anaconda distribution contains [packages](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs) related to scientific computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Package Management** - For some development reasons, you might want to have multiple versions of the same package installed on your machine. Also, you might want to install a package for a specific project but not for all projects. To manage what packages and what package versions are available in your coding environment, you can use **virtual environments**. For more information read about [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows and pip** - For binary packages, Windows does not always play nicely with pip. Sometimes you need to get a .whl (wheel) file and install that with pip. If you download a package_name.whl, save it where you can get to it from the command line. Maneuver there from the command line and type:\n",
